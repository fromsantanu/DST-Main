# DST-Main : Descriptive Statistics
The scope includes application of mean, medean and mode, varience, covarience, standard deviation, and concept of quartiles and quantiles.

## Key DST Projects
- [Assessing Blood Pressure Stability Among Individuals or Group](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project1-STM-Blood-Pressure-Stability)  : Here blood pressure study of systolic readings of two individuals indicate that one is stable and other is heavily fluctuating causing greater risk of heart attack.
- [Analysis of Total Cholestrol Level Among Group of Patients](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project2-STM-Analysis-of-Total-Cholestrol-Level)  : The program analyzes spread of Total-Cholestrol-Level readings from mean value. 
- [Estimating New Cases Using Poisson Distribution Method](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project3-STM-New-Cases-Estimation-Using-Poisson-Distribution)  : Predict new diseases cases using Poisson Distribution method (A way to eveluate probality distribution).
- [Statistical analysis of Diabetic population](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project4-STM-Analysis-of-High-Blood-Sugar-Population)  : Statistical analysis of Diabetic population in a specific region using descriptive statistics and histograms.
- [Correlation between Busy Hospital and Chances of Survival](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project5-STM-Busy-Hospital-Vs-Heart-Survival-Rates)  : Data for hospitals conducting heart surgeries are compared and a correlation have been established between chances of survival of their patients.
- [Correlation between Smoking and Chances of Lung Cancer](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project6-STM-The-Relation-Between-Smoking-And-Lung-Cancer)  : We have tried to find a correlation between smoking rates of cigerettes and chances of developing lung cancer.
- [Calculating the mean hospital stay of patients](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project7-STM-Calculating-Mean-Hospital-Stay)  : Calculating mean hospital stay for admitted patients using Central Limit Theorem with a population of 10000 patients and using 1000 samples of 50 patients.
- [Selections in medical colleges](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project8-STM-Selection-In-Medical-Colleges)  : Three lacs candidates sat for entrence test. Only 10000 seats are available for admission. Out of these 1000 are in the top level medical colleges and rest will be absorbed by regional colleges.
- [Assessment of Hospital Admission Time](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project9-STM-Hospital-Admission-Time)  : To analyze the distribution of hospital admission times in a healthcare facility to understand the spread and central tendency of the data.
- [Calculating Post Surgery Recovery Time](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project10-STM-Post-Surgery-Recovery-Time)  :To demonstrate the use of violin plots in visualizing the distribution of patient recovery times after surgery in different age groups.
- [Dealing With Factors Affecting A Disease](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project11-Dealing-With-Factors-Affecting-A-Disease)  :To demonstrate the use of dependent, independent and confounding variables.
