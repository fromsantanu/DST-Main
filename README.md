# STM-Main : Statistical Methods
In this section we are using various statistical methods to analyse health conditions of a population or a single person (in some cases). We also use various methods of predictions to deal with uncertainty,

## Key STM Projects
- [Assessing Blood Pressure Stability Among Individuals or Group](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project1-STM-Blood-Pressure-Stability)  : Here blood pressure study of systolic readings of two individuals indicate that one is stable and other is heavily fluctuating causing greater risk of heart attack.
- [Analysis of Total Cholestrol Level Among Group of Patients](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project2-STM-Analysis-of-Total-Cholestrol-Level)  : The program analyzes spread of Total-Cholestrol-Level readings from mean value. 
- [Estimating New Cases Using Poisson Distribution Method](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project3-STM-New-Cases-Estimation-Using-Poisson-Distribution)  : Predict new diseases cases using Poisson Distribution method (A way to eveluate probality distribution).
- [Statistical analysis of Diabetic population](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project4-STM-Analysis-of-High-Blood-Sugar-Population)  : Statistical analysis of Diabetic population in a specific region using descriptive statistics and histograms.
- [Correlation between Busy Hospital and Chances of Survival](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project5-STM-Busy-Hospital-Vs-Heart-Survival-Rates)  : Data for hospitals conducting heart surgeries are compared and a correlation have been established between chances of survival of their patients.
- [Correlation between Smoking and Chances of Lung Cancer](https://github.com/fromsantanu/Project6-STM-The-Relation-Between-Smoking-And-Lung-Cancer)  : We have tried to find a correlation between smoking rates of cigerettes and chances of developing lung cancer.
